# Automated Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Techniques

This repository showcases various automated EDA techniques using different Python libraries to quickly gain insights into datasets and understand their structures.

## Introduction

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a crucial step in the data analysis process. It involves visualizing, summarizing, and understanding the main characteristics of a dataset. While manual EDA is effective, automated techniques can speed up the process and provide quick insights.
